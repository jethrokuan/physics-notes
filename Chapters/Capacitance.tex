\section{Electrical Energy and Capacitance}
Here we learn that the potential energy concept is also useful in the study of electricity. Because the Coulomb force is conservative, we can define an electric potential energy corresponding to that force. In addition, we define an electric potential as the potential energy per unit charge corresponding to the electric field.

\subsection{Electric Potential Difference and Electric Potential}
Electric potential energy and electric potential are closely related concepts. The electric potential turns out to be just the electric potential energy per unit charge. This is similar to the relationship between electric force and the electric field,
which is the electric force per unit charge.

\subsection{Work and Electrical Potential Energy}
\begin{form}[Electric Potential Energy]
The change in the electric potential energy, $d PE$, of a system consisting of an object of charge $q$ moving through a displacement $d x$ in a constant electric field is given by
$$d PE = -W_{AB} = - qE_xd x$$
where Ex is the x-component of the electric field and $d x= x_f + x_i$ is the displacement of the charge along the x-axis.
SI Unit: joule (J)
\end{form}

\subsection{Electric Potential}
It is useful to define an electric potential difference $d V$ related to the potential energy by $d PE = qd V$:
\begin{form}[Electric Potential]
The electric potential difference $d V$ between points $A$ and $B$ is the change in electric potential energy as charge $q$ moves from $A$ and $B$, divided by the charge q:
$$d V = V_B - V_A = \frac{d PE}{q}$$
\end{form}
