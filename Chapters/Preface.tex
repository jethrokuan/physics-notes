\subsection*{A Note from the Author}

This set of notes are meant for those taking the Singapore Junior
Physics Olympiad(SJPO), and have been tuned to suit the level of the
competition itself. It also aids as a guide through the different
topics present. I am not held viable for any mistakes in the notes. If
there are any mistakes though, please email me at
